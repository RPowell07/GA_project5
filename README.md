## The work

For this project, you will be doing work that focuses on social impact.

The prompts are there to help jump-start your ideation process. If you would like to change or combine prompts, that's fine! If you want to find your own idea, even better. **Consult your local instructor for final approval before getting started.**  

Remember to start with a good problem statement!
